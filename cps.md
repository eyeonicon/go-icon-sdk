# Golang SDK

Golang is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is the language on which the ICON blockchain is built. The ICON SDK will make it easy for Golang developers to build applications that interact with the ICON blockchain.

At the moment of writing there is only a 4 year old and incomplete "SDK" for Golang. The code of this project is incomplete. It only have the functionality to make calls using it. So no ability to create transactions, sign them, send them to the network, etc. 

If a Golang Developer is looking to try out the ICON blockchain, he/she will have to use the do a pretty deep dive into the official Icon-Project Github Repo. This is not ideal.

This is why we decided to create a new Golang SDK, based on the existing Python SDK.

When finished, this SDK will have the following functionality:

- Make calls to the ICON blockchain

- Create transactions

- Sign transactions with a wallet / keystore file

- Send transactions to the ICON blockchain

A Golang developer will be able to just import the SDK, via the "standard Golang-way", and start building applications that interact with the ICON blockchain, just like you can with Python or Javascript.

The SDK will come with a readme file that explains how to use it. It will also come with a set of examples that show how to use the SDK. "How to send ICX", "How to call a smart contract", etc.

After the SDK is finished it will be publicly available on Github. It will be open source and free to use by anyone. 

For this project I am looking for a compensation 3000 bnUSD for worked hours.

I expect that no further explanation on the importance of a actual useable Golang SDK for ICON is. If you have any questions, please let me know.
