# Golang SDK

Golang is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is the language on which the ICON blockchain is built. The ICON SDK will make it easy for Golang developers to build applications that interact with the ICON blockchain.

At the moment of writing there is only a 4 year old and incomplete "SDK" for Golang. The code of this project is incomplete. It only have the functionality to make calls using it. So no ability to create transactions, sign them, send them to the network, etc. This is why we decided to create a new Golang SDK, based on the existing Python SDK.

When finished, this SDK will have the following functionality:

- Make calls to the ICON blockchain

- Create transactions

- Sign transactions with a wallet / keystore file

- Send transactions to the ICON blockchain
